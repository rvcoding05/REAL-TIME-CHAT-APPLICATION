*DESCRIPTION*:
For this project, I built a real-time chat application using React.js on the frontend and WebSockets (via Socket.IO) on the backend with Node.js. The idea was to create a simple, responsive chat interface where users can send and receive messages instantly—without needing to refresh the page.

The frontend is designed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS to make sure it works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. Users can enter their name, type messages, and see chat updates in real time as others send them. Messages appear in a scrollable chat box, and the latest message is always visible to keep the conversation flowing.

On the backend, I used Express.js with Socket.IO to manage connections and message broadcasting. When someone joins the chat, they receive the current message history so they can catch up on what’s been said. Every new message is shared with all connected users in real-time. For now, messages are stored temporarily in memory, but the app could easily be extended to use a database like MongoDB.

This project helped me understand how real-time communication works on the web and how frontend and backend technologies can work together to create a smooth user experience. It’s also a great starting point for building more complex chat apps with features like private messaging, notifications, or even file sharing.
